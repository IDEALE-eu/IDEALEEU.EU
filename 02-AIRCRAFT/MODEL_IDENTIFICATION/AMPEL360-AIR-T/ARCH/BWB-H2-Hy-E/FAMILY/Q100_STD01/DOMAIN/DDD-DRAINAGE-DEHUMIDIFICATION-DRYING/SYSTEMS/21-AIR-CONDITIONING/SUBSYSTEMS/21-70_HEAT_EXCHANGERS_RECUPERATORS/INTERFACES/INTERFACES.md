# Interface Control Document — 21-70_HEAT_EXCHANGERS_RECUPERATORS

## Purpose
This document defines the interfaces between 21-70_HEAT_EXCHANGERS_RECUPERATORS and other systems/subsystems.

## External Interfaces

### Electrical
- Power requirements: TBD
- Signal interfaces: TBD
- Control buses: TBD

### Mechanical
- Mounting interfaces: TBD
- Fluid connections: TBD
- Structural attachments: TBD

### Data/Control
- Communication protocols: TBD
- Data exchange formats: TBD
- Control signals: TBD

### Environmental
- Operating temperature range: TBD
- Pressure requirements: TBD
- Humidity tolerance: TBD

## Internal Interfaces
- Dependencies with other ATA-21 subsystems: TBD
- Shared resources: TBD
- Common protocols: See 21-99_COMMON/STANDARDS.md

## Interface Matrix

| Interface ID | Description | Type | Connected System | Status |
|--------------|-------------|------|------------------|--------|
| TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | DRAFT |

## Notes
- All interfaces must comply with standards defined in 21-99_COMMON/STANDARDS.md
- Interface changes require ECR/ECO approval
- Refer to system-level INTERFACE_MATRIX for cross-system dependencies
