# APPLICATIONS Directory

This directory contains application-specific integration examples and use cases for the CAI (Computer-Aided Integration) system.

## Contents

### co2_battery_examples.py
Example integration scenarios for CO2-based battery systems, demonstrating:
- Battery cell and pack modeling
- Assembly sequence definition
- Integration testing procedures
- Manufacturing simulation workflows

## Usage

Run the CO2 battery examples:
```bash
python co2_battery_examples.py
```

## Adding New Applications

When adding new application examples:
1. Create a descriptive Python module name
2. Include docstrings for all classes and functions
3. Provide runnable examples in `if __name__ == "__main__"` block
4. Update this README with a brief description
5. Follow the existing code style and structure

## Integration with Other CAI Components

- Use `PROCESS_DEFINITIONS/` for formal assembly sequences
- Reference `TOOLCHAINS/` for automated processing
- Store test cases in `INTEGRATION_TESTS/`
- Document in `DOCS/`
